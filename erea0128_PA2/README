#Project Description
The goal of the dfc.c and dfs.c programs are to be able to speak to one another while using the dfs.c programs as a distributed filesystem. Functions PUT, GET, and LIST are implemented as well as subfoldering and encryption, decryption.

The files will be encrypted and decrypted as a whole on the client side, while the server will only save or retrieve the requested files.

When typing commands onto the client side:
<request> <filename> <subfolder>
for LIST:
LIST <subfolder>

All subfolders must contain '/' first. This will not handle subfoldering of a subfolder (not part of the assignment)
